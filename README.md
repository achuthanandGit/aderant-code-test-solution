# Aderant Code Test Solution

This repository consists of 2 solutions to the problem [description] (https://github.com/achuthanandGit/aderant-code-test-solution/blob/master/Aderant%20Coding%20Test%20v2.docx)

    1. Using Brute Force method
    2. Using Greedy method

## Installation

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages.


## File Structure

Execute main.py to see the results.

brute_force_method.py contains the brute force logic to find the shortest common string.
  
greedy method.py contains the greedy and match logic to find the shortest common string.

helper_fun.py contains logic common to both brute force and greedy approach and other logics to support them.

Edit content in input_file.txt for the input to the solution.

The resultant output will be written in output_file.txt file.


### Unit Test

Test folder contains the script to run all necessary unit tests. 

unit_test_file.txt will have the test input data for the unit tests.

Execute unit_test.py script to see the unit test results.
